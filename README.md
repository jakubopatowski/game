# C++ startup project for 2D pixel game

This is my starting project for 2D pixel art game in C++ using SFML.
Project is managed by CMake.

Also I will add some tutorial points about some stuff related to C++ development, project management, CMake and GitHub usage etc.

Enjoy!

## Starting GitHub repo

- Creating ReadMe.md [how-to](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

## SFML tutorials

- Beautiful [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6xSOsbVA1eb_QqMTTcql_3PdOiE928up) about SFML and C++ game development for beginners.

## Project management

- Curse in [UML standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnMQ8HlmeXc) for beginners. Everyone who thinks seriously about programming, should at least know how to draw a class diagram.
- I'm using [PlantUml](https://plantuml.com/) to manage my uml project design.
  It is a text base tool for generating all kinds of uml diagrams. Highly recommended for software architects.

## C++ Advanced tutorials
